# LinkedIn Jobs Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze data related to job postings on LinkedIn, providing insights into job trends, required skills, and other key factors that job seekers and professionals might find useful.

## Dataset Description
- **Source**: [1.3M Linkedin Jobs & Skills (2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/1-3m-linkedin-jobs-and-skills-2024)
- **Structure**: Briefly describe the dataset structure, including key columns such as job title, company, location, skills, and any other relevant attributes.
- **Purpose**: Explain why this dataset was chosen and how it supports the analysis objectives.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Standardizing column names and data formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing trends in job postings (e.g., by location, industry, or company).
   - Analyzing the most in-demand skills and roles.
3. **Insights and Patterns**:
   - Extracting key trends and observations from the data.
   - Identifying actionable insights for job seekers or recruiters.
